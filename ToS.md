# Terms of Service
Thank you for choosing EternalGaius as your Server Utility Discord bot. By using EternalGaius - which is collectively referred to as the "Service" further - you agree with the following Terms. If you disagree with any of these Terms, you are prohibited from accessing the "Service".
 
## General Terms
*All Terms are exactly that: Terms. They are **not** guidelines and must **not** be violated under any circumstances.*

By using the "Service", you **immediately** agree that you accept the [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), and you are **fully acknowledged** that your account can be suspended from using the "Service" if you violate the Discord Terms of Service in any way.

We prohibit our "Service" users, and any guilds (servers) and/or threads and/or forums associated with the usage of our "Service", in any way, promote the violation of these Terms and Guidelines listed below, and/or promote the violation of the Discord's Terms linked above. Any violations, if found, will be handled accordingly up to a suspension from using our "Service".

If we don’t immediately act on any violation, given that they have not been considered or looked through, that **does not** mean we’re giving up any of our legal rights (such as acting in the future). If any part of these Terms and Guidelines listed below ends up being invalid or unenforceable based on a decision by any court or competent authority, the rest of these Terms will not be affected.

## Service Guidelines and Restrictions

### Content Posting
Our "Service" allows you to post, link, store, and otherwise make available certain information, text or material ("Content"). You are **fully** responsible for the data you chose to share on your profile, and we, the "Service" provider, will take no responsibility for the information you share. However, we reserve the right to take any action against your "Content" or revoke your access to the "Service", if it/they include(s) but are not limited to the following:

- "Content" involving harassment;
- "Content" referenced by/directly pointed towards NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content;
- "Content" including threats of any kind;
- "Content" including link(s) to malicious content, hyperlinked or directly linked;
- "Content" discussing politics;
- "Content" including any section violating __[Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)__

### Interruptions
Using the "Service" to, directly or indirectly, affect other users' experience in any way is strictly prohibited. A suspension of your "Service" usage will be considered, depending on severity, if we find it the case.

Using any unknown and/or unnoticed and/or unfixed bugs and/or exploits of the "Service" for any unintended and/or unfair behavior and/or affecting the "Service" in any way is prohibited. A suspension of your "Service" usage will be considered, depending on severity, if we find it the case.

### Selling Accounts
At EternalGaius, we offer collectible badges known as the "EternalGaius Badges" (referred to as "badges" or "badge" further.), to show our appreciation for the people who directly or indirectly contributed to the "service".

Holders of these "badges" are responsible for preventing the selling of these "badges" to other users in exchange for any material or digital goods. What constitutes as "material or digital goods" will be determined at the "service" provider's sole discretion.

If we find any "badge" holders violating this term, a removal of these "badges" from your "EternalGaius Profile Account" and/or a suspension to the "service" will be considered. This type of punishment will affect the "seller" of the badge and/or the "receiving user" of the "account" that these "badges" belong to.

## Modifications
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least a 7 days notice before any new terms take effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

Your continued use of the "Service" after we announce any modifications to the Terms on this “Service” will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Terms.

This document is effective as of 16th June 2024 and will remain in effect except concerning any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being changed on one of the Official Releases of the “service”.

## Suspension
If you violate any Terms listed above, the "Service" developers reserve the right to issue you a warning regarding the violation or immediately suspend your access to the Service with or without reasons, depending on the offense.

While you have the right to appeal your suspension to the "service", we do not guarantee that the "service" providers will approve your appeal, and do not guarantee that you'll be 100% whitelisted from all the "service" features, you may be denied to access certain features of the "service" in respect with your prior suspension reasons.
